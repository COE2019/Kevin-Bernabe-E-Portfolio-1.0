                    <p>Hi! My name is Kevin-...</p><br>
                    <p>...Yea its written up there^</p><br>
                    <p>I'm a developer and a designer! I program stuff and make things pretty.</p><br>
                    <p>In today's standards, just being pretty is not enough. Which is why its my job to make sure that things are beauty and brains!</p><br>
                    <p>I was exposed to digital technology at a very young age, you can say that it was love at first sight, I say however it was more than that, something closely equated to an obsession. Even though I was exposed to it at the age of 3, it was not until I was 15 years old that I got my own personal computer to tinker with. 2015 was the year, my first warmachine was a humble Intel Core 2 Duo partnered with an NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GT. It was not up to the modern standards at the time, but it was enough to keep me company for 3 years.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>My past experiences were a major influence in me picking my college course. But the biggest influence were my social status and my country. If I had the ability and option to choose what I really wanted, I would pursue astrophysics as I equally if not more, love the mysteries of the universe.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>My school life was filled with pretty exciting stories. Looking back to it, I never expected to fill a page with relevant stories. I excelled in my studies, I ranked first when I was in pre-school, 2nd in my first grade, 4th in my second grade, 8th in my 3rd grade, I think you can see the pattern here. The higher the grade I went, the lower I was ranked, it has a pretty funny pattern to it too. During in my highschool, I still excelled in my studies but I was ranked in the lower end of the achievers. However, I excelled most in extracurricular activities, I love trying out new interesting things you see, since I feel like my beginner's luck is really high, I often tried out new stuff. And I won a lot, like a lot lot.
